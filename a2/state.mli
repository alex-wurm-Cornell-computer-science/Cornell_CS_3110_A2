   including the adventurer's current room, the rooms that have been visited,
   and functions that cause the state to change.

(** The abstract type of values representing the game state. *)
type t 

(** [init_state a] is the initial state of the game when playing adventure [a]. 
    In that state the adventurer is currently located in the starting room,
    and they have visited only that room. *)
val init_state : Adventure.t -> t

(** [current_room_id st] is the identifier of the room in which the adventurer
    currently is located in state [st]. *)
val current_room_id : t -> string

(** [visited st] is a set-like list of the room identifiers the adventurer has 
    visited in state [st]. The adventurer has visited a room [rm] if their
    current room location is or has ever been [rm]. *)
val visited : t -> string list

(** [current_score st] is the player's score at the time the command is issued.
 The adventurer's score increases each time they visit a new room or 
 bring an item to the treasure room. *)
val current_score : t -> int

(** The type representing the result of an attempted movement. *)
type result = Legal of t | Illegal

(** [go exit adv st] is [r] if attempting to go through exit [exit] in state 
    [st] and adventure [adv] results in [r].  If [exit] is an exit from the 
    adventurer's current room, then [r] is [Legal st'], where in [st'] the 
    adventurer is now located in the room to which [exit] leads.  Otherwise, 
    the result is [Illegal]. 
    Effects: none.  [go] is not permitted to do any printing. *)
val go : Adventure.exit_name -> Adventure.t -> t -> result

(** [update_state old_state result] is the state that results from command go.
If the command is [Illegal] then the previous state is returned. If the 
comamnd is [Legal t] the new state [t] is returned. *)
